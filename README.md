## Study Instructions

To help you systematically study the concepts covered in this repository, follow the sequence outlined below. Each file represents a key concept in reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The recommended order will build your understanding from fundamental algorithms to more advanced methods.

### Study Sequence

1. **A* Search Algorithm (`a_star - 2.py`)**
   - **Objective**: Understand the A* algorithm for pathfinding and graph traversal.
   - **Why First**: A* provides a good foundation in search algorithms, which is crucial for understanding more complex decision-making processes.

2. **Markov Decision Processes (MDP) Basic (`mdp_basic - 3.py`)**
   - **Objective**: Learn the basics of MDPs, including states, actions, rewards, and the concept of transitions.
   - **Why Second**: MDPs are fundamental to reinforcement learning, as they define the environment in which agents operate.

3. **Value Iteration (`value_iteration - 4.py`)**
   - **Objective**: Study the value iteration algorithm for computing optimal policies in MDPs.
   - **Why Third**: Value iteration is an important algorithm for understanding how to derive the best possible strategies in a given environment.

4. **Policy Iteration (`policy_iteration - 5.py`)**
   - **Objective**: Explore policy iteration for finding optimal policies in MDPs.
   - **Why Fourth**: Policy iteration provides an alternative to value iteration, offering insights into different approaches for policy optimization.

5. **Monte Carlo Methods (`monte_carlo - 6.py`)**
   - **Objective**: Understand Monte Carlo methods for estimating the value of states and actions through simulation.
   - **Why Fifth**: Monte Carlo methods offer a way to learn about optimal policies without requiring a complete model of the environment.

6. **Q-Learning (`q_learning - 7.py`)**
   - **Objective**: Learn Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm used to learn the value of actions directly.
   - **Why Sixth**: Q-learning is a cornerstone of model-free reinforcement learning, helping to understand how agents can learn effective strategies through experience.

7. **SARSA (`sarsa - 1.py`)**
   - **Objective**: Study SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action), a reinforcement learning algorithm similar to Q-learning but with on-policy updates.
   - **Why Seventh**: SARSA complements Q-learning by providing insights into different approaches to policy learning and evaluation.
